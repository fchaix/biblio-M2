	abstract = {Predicting whether and how organisms will successfully cope with climate change presents critical questions for biologists and environmental scientists. Models require knowing how organisms interact with their abiotic environment, as well understanding biotic interactions that include a network of symbioses in which all species are embedded. Bacterial symbionts of insects offer valuable models to examine how microbes can facilitate and constrain adaptation to a changing environment. While some symbionts confer plasticity that accelerates adaptation, long-term bacterial mutualists of insects are characterized by tight lifestyle constraints, genome deterioration, and vulnerability to thermal stress. These essential bacterial partners are eliminated at high temperatures, analogous to the loss of zooanthellae during coral bleaching. Recent field-based studies suggest that thermal sensitivity of bacterial mutualists constrains insect responses. In this sense, highly dependent mutualisms may be the Achilles' heel of thermal responses in insects.},

	abstract = {Coral microbiology is an emerging field, driven largely by a desire to understand, and ultimately prevent, the worldwide destruction of coral reefs. The mucus layer, skeleton and tissues of healthy corals all contain large populations of eukaryotic algae, bacteria and archaea. These microorganisms confer benefits to their host by various mechanisms, including photosynthesis, nitrogen fixation, the provision of nutrients and infection prevention. Conversely, in conditions of environmental stress, certain microorganisms cause coral bleaching and other diseases. Recent research indicates that corals can develop resistance to specific pathogens and adapt to higher environmental temperatures. To explain these findings the coral probiotic hypothesis proposes the occurrence of a dynamic relationship between symbiotic microorganisms and corals that selects for the coral holobiont that is best suited for the prevailing environmental conditions. Generalization of the coral probiotic hypothesis has led us to propose the hologenome theory of evolution.},

The bacteria are transmitted vertically via the aphid ovary, and the association is obligate for both partners: Bacteria-free aphids grow poorly and produce few or no offspring, and Buchnera are both unknown apart from aphids and apparently unculturable. The symbiosis has a nutritional basis. Specifically, bacterial provisioning of essential amino acids has been demonstrated. Nitrogen recycling, however, is not quantitatively important to the nutrition of aphid species studied, and there is strong evidence against bacterial involvement in the lipid and sterol nutrition of aphids. Buchnera have been implicated in various non-nutritional functions. Of these, just one has strong experimental support: promotion of aphid transmission of circulative viruses. It is argued that strong parallels may exist between the nutritional interactions (including the underlying mechanisms) in the aphid-Buchnera association and other insect symbioses with intracellular microorganisms.},

	abstract = {1. Bacterial symbionts play a prominent role in insect nutritional ecology by aiding in digestion of food or providing nutrients that are limited or lacking in the diet. Thereby, endosymbionts open niches to their insect host that would otherwise be unavailable.2. Currently, several other ecologically relevant traits mediated by endosymbionts are being investigated, including enhanced parasite resistance, enhanced heat tolerance, and influences on insect–plant interactions such as manipulation of plant physiology to the benefit of the insect.3. Traits mediated by endosymbionts are often identified by correlative studies where traits are found to be altered in the presence of a particular symbiont. Recent developments in genomic tools offer the opportunity for studying the impact of bacteria–insect symbioses under natural conditions in a population and community ecology context. In vivo experiments specifically testing putative functions of endosymbionts in parallel to population-level studies on the prevalence of endosymbionts allow disentangling host versus symbiont contribution to phenotypic variability observed in individuals. Effects of symbionts on host phenotype are often large and relevant to host fitness, e.g. by significantly enhancing survival or fecundity in a context-dependent manner.4. Predominantly vertically transmitted endosymbionts contribute to the heritable genetic variation present in a host species. Phenotypic variation on which selection can act may be due to differences either among host genomes, symbiont genomes, or genotype × genotype interactions. Therefore the holobiont, i.e. the host including all symbionts, should be regarded as the unit of selection as the association between host and symbionts may affect the fitness of the holobiont depending on the environment.},

In Israel, Rickettsia is found in both the B and Q of B. tabaci biotypes, and while all other secondary symbionts are located in the bacteriomes, Rickettsia can occupy most of the body cavity of the insect. We tested whether Rickettsia influences the biology of B. tabaci and found that exposing a Rickettsia-containing population to increasing temperatures significantly increases its tolerance to heat shock that reached {40°C}, compared to a Rickettsia-free population. This increase in tolerance to heat shock was not associated with specific induction of heat-shock protein gene expression; however, it was associated with reduction in Rickettsia numbers as was assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses. To assess the causes for thermotolerance when Rickettsia is reduced, we tested whether its presence is associated with the induction of genes required for thermotolerance. We found that under normal {25°C} rearing temperature, genes associated with response to stress such as cytoskeleton genes are induced in the Rickettsia-containing population. Thus, the presence of Rickettsia in B. tabaci under normal conditions induces the expression of genes required for thermotolerance that under high temperatures indirectly lead to this tolerance.},

Yet, the overall regulation scale is very modest, rarely exceeding a factor of three. A large number of genes show differential expression in different life stages and a distinct expression pattern of genes possibly involved in symbiotic function as compared with housekeeping genes is apparent. However, these transcriptional changes are small as compared with the changes in the number of bacteria during host development, which is the highest in pupae and in young imagines. Control of replication of the bacteria in certain life stages may therefore be the decisive parameter influencing the overall level of gene expression of Blochmannia in the animal.

A complementary focus is now emerging on the Hsps of both model and nonmodel organisms undergoing stress in nature, on the roles of Hsps in the stress physiology of whole multicellular eukaryotes and the tissues and organs they comprise, and on the ecological and evolutionary correlates of variation in Hsps and the genes that encode them. This focus discloses that (a) expression of Hsps can occur in nature, (b) all species have hsp genes but they vary in the patterns of their expression, (c) Hsp expression can be correlated with resistance to stress, and (d) species' thresholds for Hsp expression are correlated with levels of stress that they naturally undergo. These conclusions are now well established and may require little additional confirmation; many significant questions remain unanswered concerning both the mechanisms of Hsp-mediated stress tolerance at the organismal level and the evolutionary mechanisms that have diversified the hsp genes.},

	abstract = {The role of chaperone proteins in the winter survival of insects was evaluated in freeze tolerant gall fly larvae, Eurosta solidaginis. Levels of four heat shock proteins (Hsp110, Hsp70, Hsp60, Hsp40), two glucose-regulated proteins (Grp75, Grp78) and three others (tailless complex polypeptide 1 [{TCP-1]}, {αA-crystallin}, {αB-crystallin)} were tracked in outdoor larvae from September to April and, in addition, laboratory experiments assessed chilling, freezing, and anoxia effects on these proteins. Gall fly larvae showed consistent elevation of Hsp110, Hsp70, Hsp40, Grp78 and {αB-crystallin} over the late autumn and winter months, generally 1.5–2.0-fold higher than September values. This suggests that these proteins contribute to cell preservation over the winter months via protection and stabilization of macromolecules. By contrast, levels of the mitochondrial Hsp60 fell to just 40\% of September values by midwinter, paralleling the responses by numerous mitochondrial enzymes and consistent with a reduction in total mitochondria numbers over the winter. None of the proteins were altered when 15 {°C} acclimated larvae were chilled to 3 {°C} for 24 h but Hsp70, Hsp40 and Grp75 increased during freezing at −16 {°C} for 24 h whereas others (Hsp110, {TCP-1} and both crystallins) increased significantly after larvae thawed at 3 {°C.} Anoxia exposure (24 h under N2 gas at 15 {°C)} elevated levels of Hsp70, Grp78 and the two crystallins. Levels of active hyperphosphorylated heat shock transcription factor ({HSF1)} were also analyzed, giving an indication of the state of hsp gene transcription in the larvae. {HSF1} was high in September and October but fell to less than 40\% of September values in midwinter consistent with suppression of gene transcription in diapause larvae. {HSF1} levels responded positively to freezing and increased robustly by 4.9-fold under anoxia.

Here, we review the recent evidence of the relationship between stress resistance and inducible Hsp expression, including a characterization of factors that induce the heat shock response and a discussion of the associated costs. We report on studies of stress resistance including mild stress, effects of high larval densities, inbreeding and age on Hsp expression, as well as on natural variation in the expression of Hsps. The relationship between Hsps and life history traits is discussed with special emphasis on the ecological and evolutionary relevance of Hsps. It is known that up-regulation of the Hsps is a common cellular response to increased levels of non-native proteins that facilitates correct protein folding/refolding or degradation of non-functional proteins. However, we also suggest that the expression level of Hsp in each species and population is a balance between benefits and costs, i.e. a negative impact on growth, development rate and fertility as a result of overexpression of Hsps. To date, investigations have focused primarily on the Hsp70 family. There is evidence that representatives of this Hsp family and other molecular chaperones play significant roles in relation to stress resistance. Future studies including genomic and proteonomic analyses will increase our understanding of molecular chaperones in stress research.},

	abstract = {Terrestrial arthropods survive subzero temperatures by becoming either freeze tolerant (survive body fluid freezing) or freeze avoiding (prevent body fluid freezing). Protein ice nucleators ({PINs)}, which limit supercooling and induce freezing, and antifreeze proteins ({AFPs)}, which function to prevent freezing, can have roles in both freeze tolerance and avoidance. Many freeze-tolerant insects produce hemolymph {PINs}, which induce freezing at high subzero temperatures thereby inhibiting lethal intracellular freezing. Some freeze-tolerant species have {AFPs} that function as cryoprotectants to prevent freeze damage. Although the mechanism of this cryoprotection is not known, it may involve recrystallization inhibition and perhaps stabilization of the cell membrane. Freeze-avoiding species must prevent inoculative freezing initiated by external ice across the cuticle and extend supercooling abilities. Some insects remove {PINs} in the winter to promote supercooling, whereas others have selected against surfaces with ice-nucleating abilities on an evolutionary time scale. However, many freeze-avoiding species do have proteins with ice-nucleating activity, and these proteins must be masked in winter. In the beetle Dendroides canadensis, {AFPs} in the hemolymph and gut inhibit ice nucleators. Also, hemolymph {AFPs} and those associated with the layer of epidermal cells under the cuticle inhibit inoculative freezing. Two different insect {AFPs} have been characterized. One type from the beetles D. canadensis and Tenebrio molitor consists of 12- and 13-mer repeating units with disulfide bridges occurring at least every six residues. The spruce budworm {AFP} lacks regular repeat units. Both have much higher activities than any known {AFPs.}},

	abstract = {In Escherichia coli and mitochondria, the molecular chaperone {DnaJ} is required not only for protein folding but also for selective degradation of certain abnormal polypeptides. Here we demonstrate that in the yeast cytosol, the homologous chaperone Ydj1 is also required for ubiquitin-dependent degradation of certain abnormal proteins. The temperature-sensitive ydj1-151 mutant showed a large defect in the overall breakdown of short-lived cell proteins and abnormal polypeptides containing amino acid analogs, especially at 38 degrees C. By contrast, the degradation of long-lived cell proteins, which is independent of ubiquitin, was not altered nor was cell growth affected. The inactivation of Ydj1 markedly reduced the rapid, ubiquitin-dependent breakdown of certain beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) fusion polypeptides. Although degradation of N-end rule substrates (arginine-beta-gal and leucine-beta-gal) and the B-type cyclin Clb5-beta-gal occurred normally, degradation of the abnormal polypeptide ubiquitin-proline-beta-gal (Ub-P-beta-gal) and that of the short-lived normal protein Gcn4 were inhibited. As a consequence of reduced degradation of Ub-P-beta-gal, the beta-gal activity was four to five times higher in temperature-sensitive ydj1-151 mutant cells than in wild-type cells; thus, the folding and assembly of this enzyme do not require Ydj1 function. In wild-type cells, but not in ydj1-151 mutant cells, this chaperone is associated with the short-lived substrate Ub-P-beta-gal and not with stable beta-gal constructs. Furthermore, in the ydj1-151 mutant, the ubiquitination of Ub-P-beta-gal was blocked and the total level of ubiquitinated protein in the cell was reduced. Thus, Ydj1 is essential for the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of certain proteins. This chaperone may facilitate the recognition of unfolded proteins or serve as a cofactor for certain ubiquitin-ligating enzymes.},

Natural populations of pea aphids in California contain at least two facultative bacterial secondary symbionts (pea aphid secondary symbiont, {PASS}, or pea aphid rickettsia, {PAR)} in a range of frequencies throughout the state.2. Two pea aphid clones without either of these facultative associates failed to reproduce in the first 8 days after the final moult if they had been heat-stressed for a period of about 4 h at 39 {°C} as 1-day-old larvae in the laboratory.3. Aphids infected artificially with {PASS}, however, were able to produce up to 48\% of the normal complement of offspring produced by {PASS-positive} aphids that had not been heat-stressed. Clones infected artificially with {PAR} did not have the same advantage as those with {PASS} after heat stress.4. In aphids without {PASS} or {PAR}, heat stress reduced the number of bacteriocytes (in which the obligate primary symbiont, Buchnera, resides) to 7\% of non-heat-stressed aphids, while aphids with only {PASS} retained 70\% of their bacteriocytes. Bacteriocytes in aphids with {PAR} but not {PASS} were reduced to 42\% of controls.5. When larvae were heat-stressed as older instars (5 days old), a similar pattern emerged, though the effect of heat stress was less extreme. Clones containing {PASS} produced the most offspring, three to 14 times as many as aphids without {PASS} or {PAR.} Aphids with {PAR} only, or {PASS} and {PAR} together, had reduced or no advantage over aphids without facultative symbionts.6. Aphids of all clones that had been heat-stressed as later instars gave birth to a variable number of stillborn offspring. Aphids without facultative symbionts produced the most stillborn larvae.7. Field studies showed a higher incidence of {PASS} in aphids collected in California in summer compared with aphids from the same sites collected 2–4 months earlier. The difference was significant in two of three widely dispersed locations.},

Small heat shock proteins ({sHSPs)} usually act as molecular chaperones to prevent proteins from being denatured in extreme conditions. We first report the {sHSP21} gene, named as Ap-{sHSP21}, in the Chinese oak silkworm Antheraea pernyi (Lepidoptera: Saturniidae). The full-length {cDNA} of Ap-{sHSP21} is 976 bp, including a 5′-untranslated region ({UTR)} of 99 bp, a 3′-{UTR} of 316 bp and an open reading frame ({ORF)} of 561 bp encoding a polypeptide of 186 amino acids. The deduced A. pernyi {sHSP21} protein sequence reveals the percent identity is 82–93\% in comparison to other {sHSPs} from insects. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-{PCR} ({qRT-PCR)} analysis shows that Ap-{sHSP21} expression is higher in testis than that in other examined tissues and significantly up-regulated after heat shock. In addition, prokaryotic expression and purification of the Ap-{sHSP21} protein were performed. {SDS–PAGE} and Western blot analysis demonstrated that a 25 {kDa} recombinant protein was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli cells and the purified recombinant protein was also confirmed to protect restriction enzymes from thermal inactivation. The expression of Ap-{sHSP21} was significantly down-regulated after {RNA} interference, which was confirmed by {qRT-PCR} and Western blot analysis. All together, these results suggest that Ap-{sHSP21} play a key role in thermal tolerance.},

We investigated neurophysiological correlates of chill and hyperthermic coma in Drosophila melanogaster. Coma resulting from anoxia causes a profound loss of K+ homeostasis characterized by a surge in extracellular K+ concentration ([K+]o) in the brain. We recorded [K+]o in the brain during exposure to both low and high temperatures and observed a similar surge in [K+]o which recovered to baseline concentrations following return to room temperature. We also found that rapid cold hardening ({RCH)} using a cold pretreatment (4 {°C} for 2 h; 2 h recovery at room temperature) increased the peak brain [K+]o reached during a subsequent chill coma and increased the rates of accumulation and clearance of [K+]o. We conclude that {RCH} preserves K+ homeostasis in the fly brain during exposure to cold by reducing the temperature sensitivity of the rates of homeostatic processes.},
